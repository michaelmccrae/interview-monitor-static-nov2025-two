        "While tariffs do create uncertainty that can affect business decisions, empirical evidence and economic consensus suggest that other factors such as overall economic trends, demand, wage pressures, and global supply chains often play a larger or more direct role in hiring and major investment decisions than tariff uncertainty alone.",
        "The claim that the 2018 tariff increases were much smaller and narrower is factually incorrect; the tariffs imposed in 2018 were historically large and broad, covering a wide range of goods and implemented relatively quickly. Moreover, empirical studies often show effects on prices manifesting over variable and sometimes shorter timeframes depending on goods and market conditions.",

While productivity growth can help absorb some cost increases, the assertion that recent significant productivity increases have offset tariff impacts on prices is not strongly supported by data from the relevant period, where inflationary pressures increased despite modest productivity gains."
