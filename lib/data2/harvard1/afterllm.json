        "Banking as a formalized practice with concepts of deposits, loans, and trust evolved more clearly in ancient Mesopotamia around 2000-3000 BCE, which is roughly 4000-5000 years ago, but the description here is simplified and partially inaccurate about the continuity and specific origins.",
        "While ancient temples often did act as places to store valuables and facilitate loans, the characterization of banking 4000 years ago as described oversimplifies and generalizes various separate practices; also, detailed historical evidence is somewhat ambiguous about the exact mechanisms described.",
        "The etymology of the word 'banker' is generally associated with the Italian word 'banca' meaning bench or counter used by money changers in Renaissance Italy, around the 14th-15th centuries, not from 'a plank' 4000 years ago."
