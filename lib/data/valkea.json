It's One, two yeah. I can hear you fine. I can hear you Let me just see that we do have. Yeah. Okay. And, of course, as well too, you wanna start or stop again, no problem at all. Right? Yep. Okay. Okay. Resources is exploring Finland's highly prospective Central Lapland Greenstone Belt. B2Gold, Agnico Eagle, and Kinross are all all B2Gold, Agnico Eagle, and Kinross all own properties are Jason de Balkia. CEO and executive chair is Chris Donaldson. Chris, welcome back to Mining Stock Daily. Hi, Michael. Thanks, thanks for having me, and and welcome yourself to Mining Stock Daily. This is great. Chris, let's just step back for a moment before we get into Volkia. This is a really significant mining region. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's gaining a lot of attention. You know? Last year, I was talking about it as an emerging district, and and I think it it's arrived. The Fraser Institute has just ranked at the number one mining jurisdiction in in the world. And, you know, certainly, as evidenced by, you know, the recent discovery or, you know, five years ago, the discovery with Rupert and how it's advanced and the fact that there's so many majors in the area. And not just all of Finland, you know, specifically in the in the northern region where we're at in the Lapland. You know, as as you mentioned, we got b two gold on one side of us with their joint venture with Orion, Agnico Eagle, and, I mean, it's the largest gold mine producing gold mine in Europe with the with the Kiedla mine. We've got Kinross on the other side of us and and then then Rupert as well. So it's, yeah, certainly exciting region, and and it's been a real pleasure to work there. I've worked in many regions over the years, and and the efficiency of the workers and and, you know, getting our permits and all this kind of stuff has has been as as good as I've ever seen it. So what assets are do Vakia hold, what are you advancing? Yeah. So, you know, we're a relatively new company. So thirteen months ago, we we acquired a basket of exploration properties, gold exploration properties right in the heart of what's what you know, right in the Lapland there. The main one that we own so we own five of them a 100%. The main one is one called Pana, which has a discovery on it, and we've been drilling on it and are currently drilling on it. We also have two joint ventures. We have two additional properties that Rupert Resources is earning in up to 70% on, And then we have our legacy Australian assets, which are around the Fosterville mine in, you know, Australia that we've joint ventured out to a company called s two resources, and they're earning in up to 8080%. Who's on the team at Volcano? Well, we're still pretty lean. It's you know, myself, you know, I'm the CEO and and exec chair. Our chief geologist is doctor Chris Leslie who's you know, he's probably is most well known for the Blackwater discovery, which is now our mined by Artemis. You know, we've got Liz Monger who runs our marketing, and she's been around quite a quite a while. But, you know, some of the key board members that we have, George Salamis, many of you guys would know from Integra. He actually cut his teeth in in Finland, and and he's our lead director. Lived in Finland for for a period while he was running a company called Reederhaden. And Reederhaden started out, you know, kind of at our stage. He was able to drill it out, put a resource on it, and between 1999 and 02/2006, he then sold it to Agnique Eagle. And that's what is now the key to the mine. And so we're right adjacent to that. He sees a lot of similarities between, you know, what we have right now and what he was given when when he started. So happy to have him involved. And I guess the the the most recent addition, you know, we did a financing back in June and attracted some really good good people and and and namely Michael Gentile came in as a cornerstone investor. He owns 999.9%, and he brought in a couple of colleagues as well. So we we actually have four individuals that own 9.9% of the the the company. So we we managed to keep our share structure pretty pretty tight in these early days and certainly appreciate the the support from from Michael. You know, he's been a very, you know, a prolific investor and has done extremely well and and has been talking up his book and and our story, and and that's helped us tremendously. Quite a get if you can extract Michael Chantilly from Quebec. So but tell us about Rupert Resources. I mean, that was kind of really the most significant story that came out of the region, and you've got a joint venture with them. Yeah. It's I mean, this this area is a green stone belt, and those are known to to house, you know, multiple million plus ounce deposits. And the difference is in in this region, it's it's relatively underexplored. It's it's only seen active exploration for maybe thirty five years. And you you compare that to the Abitibi, you know, which has been explored for a hundred and fifty years and and, you know, have lots of lots of big deposits there. So back to Rupert, you know, in 2020, they made a discovery similar to the one that that we have now. And, you know, within three, four years, we're able to to grow that to to almost a 4,000,000 ounce resource. And and they have been you know, over the last five years, you know, there's only been a handful of companies that have had a real success. Great Bear and Snowline and and Rupert certainly in that category as well. And it's they're entering permitting, and and, you know, that will be a mine someday. And we're about forty forty or 50 kilometers from them. So, yes, we have a joint venture with them. They're they're active on the property. I'm actually gonna meet with them in a couple of weeks up up in Finland and review what they've been doing on our properties, and we certainly share notes on exploration and and keep tabs of what everybody's doing in the area. So they've been great partners so far. You have community support? Yeah. You know, we I'll be honest with you. I mean, I come from a background where where community support up in the up in the Yukon. That was, you know, probably half my job when it was with Western Copper and Gold. It's a little different where we're at. We're in an area that is owned by the government, and and the operators are are logging companies. So there's not a huge community that you you need to interact with there. But they're they do have original peoples. The the Sasami. They have a designated land in, you know, north of us, so we're not on their territory. But they do herd their their reindeer through once a year, so you coordinate with them and and pause activities for a couple or a few weeks as as we go forward. Having said that, you know, we've only been there a year, and and one thing we did recognize is, you know, we need somebody on the ground who speaks Finnish and can interact with with the locals on a daily basis. So we've just hired someone called Jens Ronquist. He just last month, he used to run ESG and and community for Rio Tinto in in the in The Nordics. And so happy to have him there to to to have that local connection and and dialogue ongoing. So our efforts with the, you know, the locals are are are really just starting now. Lastly, Chris, news flow over the next twelve months. Yeah. I mean, we're we we've had some fantastic results to date. You know, where we're at is is we've got a discovery. We've hit some really high grade. We've hit some long sections of lower grade, so we have a potential bulk tonnage story similar to what Kilo was or is and what Rupert is proposing. We've been drilling. We started about six, eight weeks ago and doing about 2,500 meter program. We've sent a bunch of the core off for assays, and and we're waiting for those results. I'm hoping in the next five weeks or so, those always tend to get pushed back, but we're tracking for about another five weeks and and to see you know, we we were really just trying to determine how big this discovery can be. You know, can it be the next Quitela or the next Ikari, which is Rupert's project now. So it's, yeah, it's exciting times and certainly putting out, you know, gold results in in in this gold environment is is a nice thing to to do. That hasn't always been the case over the last eight years. So, yeah, it's gonna be exciting year for us up ahead. Chris, thanks for telling us at mining thanks for telling us at Mining Stock Daily. Sounds good. Thanks, Michael. Well,",

Can you hear me okay? It's\n\nSpeaker 0: One, two yeah. I can hear you fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can hear you Let\n\nSpeaker 0: me just see that we do have. Yeah. Okay. And, of course, as well too, you wanna start or stop again, no problem at all. Right?\n\nYep. Okay. Okay. Resources is exploring Finland's highly prospective Central Lapland Greenstone Belt. B2Gold, Agnico Eagle, and Kinross are all all B2Gold, Agnico Eagle, and Kinross all own properties are Jason de Balkia.\n\nCEO and executive chair is Chris Donaldson. Chris, welcome back to Mining Stock Daily.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Michael. Thanks, thanks for having me, and and welcome yourself to Mining Stock Daily. This is great.\n\nSpeaker 0: Chris, let's just step back for a moment before we get into Volkia. This is a really significant mining region.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. It's it's gaining a lot of attention. You know? Last year, I was talking about it as an emerging district, and and I think it it's arrived.\n\nThe Fraser Institute has just ranked at the number one mining jurisdiction in in the world. And, you know, certainly, as evidenced by, you know, the recent discovery or, you know, five years ago, the discovery with Rupert and how it's advanced and the fact that there's so many majors in the area. And not just all of Finland, you know, specifically in the in the northern region where we're at in the Lapland. You know, as as you mentioned, we got b two gold on one side of us with their joint venture with Orion, Agnico Eagle, and, I mean, it's the largest gold mine producing gold mine in Europe with the with the Kiedla mine. We've got Kinross on the other side of us and and then then Rupert as well.\n\nSo it's, yeah, certainly exciting region, and and it's been a real pleasure to work there. I've worked in many regions over the years, and and the efficiency of the workers and and, you know, getting our permits and all this kind of stuff has has been as as good as I've ever seen it.\n\nSpeaker 0: So what assets are do Vakia hold, what are you advancing?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So, you know, we're a relatively new company. So thirteen months ago, we we acquired a basket of exploration properties, gold exploration properties right in the heart of what's what you know, right in the Lapland there. The main one that we own so we own five of them a 100%. The main one is one called Pana, which has a discovery on it, and we've been drilling on it and are currently drilling on it.\n\nWe also have two joint ventures. We have two additional properties that Rupert Resources is earning in up to 70% on, And then we have our legacy Australian assets, which are around the Fosterville mine in, you know, Australia that we've joint ventured out to a company called s two resources, and they're earning in up to 8080%.\n\nSpeaker 0: Who's on the team at Volcano?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, we're still pretty lean. It's you know, myself, you know, I'm the CEO and and exec chair. Our chief geologist is doctor Chris Leslie who's you know, he's probably is most well known for the Blackwater discovery, which is now our mined by Artemis. You know, we've got Liz Monger who runs our marketing, and she's been around quite a quite a while. But, you know, some of the key board members that we have, George Salamis, many of you guys would know from Integra.\n\nHe actually cut his teeth in in Finland, and and he's our lead director. Lived in Finland for for a period while he was running a company called Reederhaden. And Reederhaden started out, you know, kind of at our stage. He was able to drill it out, put a resource on it, and between 1999 and 02/2006, he then sold it to Agnique Eagle. And that's what is now the key to the mine.\n\nAnd so we're right adjacent to that. He sees a lot of similarities between, you know, what we have right now and what he was given when when he started. So happy to have him involved. And I guess the the the most recent addition, you know, we did a financing back in June and attracted some really good good people and and and namely Michael Gentile came in as a cornerstone investor. He owns 999.9%, and he brought in a couple of colleagues as well.\n\nSo we we actually have four individuals that own 9.9% of the the the company. So we we managed to keep our share structure pretty pretty tight in these early days and certainly appreciate the the support from from Michael. You know, he's been a very, you know, a prolific investor and has done extremely well and and has been talking up his book and and our story, and and that's helped us tremendously.\n\nSpeaker 0: Quite a get if you can extract Michael Chantilly from Quebec. So but tell us about Rupert Resources. I mean, that was kind of really the most significant story that came out of the region, and you've got a joint venture with them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It's I mean, this this area is a green stone belt, and those are known to to house, you know, multiple million plus ounce deposits. And the difference is in in this region, it's it's relatively underexplored. It's it's only seen active exploration for maybe thirty five years. And you you compare that to the Abitibi, you know, which has been explored for a hundred and fifty years and and, you know, have lots of lots of big deposits there.\n\nSo back to Rupert, you know, in 2020, they made a discovery similar to the one that that we have now. And, you know, within three, four years, we're able to to grow that to to almost a 4,000,000 ounce resource. And and they have been you know, over the last five years, you know, there's only been a handful of companies that have had a real success. Great Bear and Snowline and and Rupert certainly in that category as well. And it's they're entering permitting, and and, you know, that will be a mine someday.\n\nAnd we're about forty forty or 50 kilometers from them. So, yes, we have a joint venture with them. They're they're active on the property. I'm actually gonna meet with them in a couple of weeks up up in Finland and review what they've been doing on our properties, and we certainly share notes on exploration and and keep tabs of what everybody's doing in the area. So they've been great partners so far.\n\nSpeaker 0: You have community support?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. You know, we I'll be honest with you. I mean, I come from a background where where community support up in the up in the Yukon. That was, you know, probably half my job when it was with Western Copper and Gold. It's a little different where we're at.\n\nWe're in an area that is owned by the government, and and the operators are are logging companies. So there's not a huge community that you you need to interact with there. But they're they do have original peoples. The the Sasami. They have a designated land in, you know, north of us, so we're not on their territory.\n\nBut they do herd their their reindeer through once a year, so you coordinate with them and and pause activities for a couple or a few weeks as as we go forward. Having said that, you know, we've only been there a year, and and one thing we did recognize is, you know, we need somebody on the ground who speaks Finnish and can interact with with the locals on a daily basis. So we've just hired someone called Jens Ronquist. He just last month, he used to run ESG and and community for Rio Tinto in in the in The Nordics. And so happy to have him there to to to have that local connection and and dialogue ongoing.\n\nSo our efforts with the, you know, the locals are are are really just starting now.\n\nSpeaker 0: Lastly, Chris, news flow over the next twelve months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I mean, we're we we've had some fantastic results to date. You know, where we're at is is we've got a discovery. We've hit some really high grade. We've hit some long sections of lower grade, so we have a potential bulk tonnage story similar to what Kilo was or is and what Rupert is proposing.\n\nWe've been drilling. We started about six, eight weeks ago and doing about 2,500 meter program. We've sent a bunch of the core off for assays, and and we're waiting for those results. I'm hoping in the next five weeks or so, those always tend to get pushed back, but we're tracking for about another five weeks and and to see you know, we we were really just trying to determine how big this discovery can be. You know, can it be the next Quitela or the next Ikari, which is Rupert's project now.\n\nSo it's, yeah, it's exciting times and certainly putting out, you know, gold results in in in this gold environment is is a nice thing to to do. That hasn't always been the case over the last eight years. So, yeah, it's gonna be exciting year for us up ahead.\n\nSpeaker 0: Chris, thanks for telling us at mining thanks for telling us at Mining Stock Daily. Sounds good. Thanks, Michael. Well,",
